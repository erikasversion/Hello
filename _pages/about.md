I bring over a decade of experience writing and teaching to technical writing.

I'm excited about this new stage of my career.

I'm also a big reader. Did you know that the sci-fi writer Ted Chiang is also a tech writer?

## Career

For over a decade, I've worked in New York City as a tutor for students Grades 3 - 12. Since 2014, I have worked independently, building relationships with clients and strategic partners.

I coach students to increase test scores by over 25% from baseline by designing and developing personalized learning programs that integrate skills, goal-setting, and mindfulness.

I inform students, parents, and educators on processes, strategies, and news relevant to their goals through writing and designing a website, blog, and email newsletter.

My students have various levels of knowledge, skills, and experience.

Work on the SAT and ACT has perfected my knowledge of grammar and sentence mechanics.


## Education

I have a BAs in English and Psychology from Georgetown University in Washington, DC and am a member of Phi Beta Kappa. 


## Additional Experience

In 2020, I created a book-focused Instagram account. Today, it has over 11,000 followers. I've also seen the account mentioned by strangers on Reddit, which is pretty cool!

In conjunction with the Instagram account, I started a curated Amazon storefront featuring discounted ebooks. My storefront has generated $159,373.44 of shipped item revenue YTD.

In 2022, I strengthened user engagement through launching a Patreon community. Member bonuses include a *Kindle 101* ebook with how-to guides and explanations to empower users to get the most of their Kindles.


## Some Places I've Lived

I grew up in South Dakota. From there, I attended college in Washington, DC and studied abroad in Florence and London. I have lived in New York City since 2008.
