title: "My Thoughts on Technical Writer HQ's Technical Writing Certificatation Course"

I enrolled in [Technical Writer HQ's Technical Writing Certificate Course](https://technicalwriterhq.com) because I wanted to gain exposure to the kinds of writing I may do as a technical writer.

As I watched the videos, I took over 80 pages of notes on the course content.

### Some things I liked:
* The course covered a lot of content!
* The videos included bullet lists and visual aids, making it easier to take notes.
* My license doesn't expire, so I can refer back to the videos anytime.
* They link to other helpful resources, from tools, like [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net), to additional learning resources, like [IdRatherBeWriting.com](https://idratherbewriting.com)'s [free API course](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/).
* They offer feedback on a capstone project, which can be used as a portfolio when applying to jobs.

### Some things I didn't like:
* While Josh's delivery was friendly, it sometimes came off stilted.
* Few written notes or outlines accompanied the videos and the videos weren't closed captioned.

### Some things I noticed:
* Some of the content would have benefited from another round of copyediting.
* Because I have a strong background teaching grammar rules and writing, I benefited more from the early content in the course ("Introduction to Technical Writing" and "Writing Great Technical Documentation") than later content ("Formatting your Technical Documentation," "Editing and Readability," and "Editing and Proofreading.") I imagine that for someone with a stronger background in tech, the opposite may be true. 

Having finished the bulk of the videos, I'm looking forward to creating my capstone project but am also a little daunted by the prospect of finding writing opportunities.

Thankfully, I came across [this Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/technicalwriting/comments/gcfmuh/a_list_of_open_source_projects_with_volunteer/) which has good tips!

I'll keep you posted on what I'm working on as I find projects!
